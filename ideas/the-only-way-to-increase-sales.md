focus: "The only way to improve revenue is to increase capacity at the constraint"
outcome: "The seed is planted in the minds of readers that randomly improving parts of their business is a poor way to incrase revenue, and focused improvement at the constraint is a vastly superior approach."
importance: "The foundation must be laid to get agreement about the importance of constraints"

Imagine your agency employs a sales team that writes one policy per day like clockwork. You come across a course that guarantees your sales team  will improve to writing two policies per day with no drop in quality or extra cost.

How much more money will your agency make? It's tempting to naively assume that you'll make twice as much money.

To make it clear why that's naive, let's further expand your imaginary agency by saying that all of your sales team's policies go through and underwriter who can only approve one policy per day. Given the underwriter limits, it's clear that, no matter how many policies your sales team writes, your agency will complete at most one policy per day. In other words, any improvement in sales that increases the number of policies written will result in exactly zero increase in revenue.

Eli Goldratt quote - improvement at a not constraint is a mirage

* connect it to their real agency
* if you want to increase revenue, improvement has to be focused on the constraint
