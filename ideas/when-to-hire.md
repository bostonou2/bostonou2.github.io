focus: "It only makes sense to hire if it improves sales or maintains sales while lowering strain on other resources."
outcome: "Readers think about hiring in the global context."
importance: "Everything is about changing the focus from local optimums to global optimums, so any steps we can take to change the focus to the global is a win."

When the effect on capacity is clear:

* Bottleneck capacity is increased (but does it make a new bottleneck)

Effect on sales:

* Sales are increased
Sales only increase if the bottleneck capacity is increased. Increases to the bottleneck capacity directly impact sales. The expected increase in sales, compared to the cost of the hire makes it straightforward to determine if the financials of the hire make sense.

** Provide example **

Be careful that the bottleneck capacity is not expanded such that the bottleneck moves. Once the bottleneck moves, any extra capacity at the initial bottleneck doesn't increase sales at all.

** Provide example **

* Sales are maintained

** Do this as a part two **
