People don't resist change.

* People embrace change when it's obvious that the change will be to their benefit.
* People embrace change when they believe those benefits will be realized.
* People embrace change when the expected benefits outweigh the cost of change.
* People embrace change when it's obvious that the cost of not changing is more than the cost of changing.
