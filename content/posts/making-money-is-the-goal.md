The goal of your agency is to make money, both now and in the future.

That may be a controversial statement, depending on what you hear when you read it. Some people hear, "Make money at all costs," where the costs include exploiting employees, cheating customers, and sacrificing everything to the almighty dollar. That is a poor, short-term view of what it means "to make money."

As an agency owner, you won't continue to invest time and money if you don't see a positive return on your investment. Without that positive ROI, you'll soon take your investments elsewhere, leaving your customers without your service and your employees unemployed. To properly serve your customers and employees, your agency must make money.

If you provide poor service and a shoddy product, it won't be long before you've lost your customers. Without customer revenue, it won't be long before the agency is closed and employees are unemployed. **To make money and provide stable employement for your employees, your agency must take care of your customers.**


As an employee, you won't provide a good service or product if 
In order to make money, both now and in the future, you must take care of three groups: customers, employees, and investors.

### Customers

If your provide poor service and a shoddy product, your customers won't be customers for long. 

* No service means no ROI and no employees
* No ROI means no employees and no customers
* No employees means no service

### Investors

Making money is the way to take care of investors. If you fail to provide a good return on investment, the investors will choose to cash out and take their investments elsewhere. With no investments, there is no business and therefore no way to serve customers or provide stable employment employees. **Making money is a requirement for serving your customers and employees.**


You serve your customers by providing a good service and product. 
If you cheat and abuse customers, you may make money in the short-term. But over time, you will erode your business and completely undercut your ability to make money in the future. Without customers, there is no revenue. Without revenue, there are no employees and no investors.

### Employees

If you exploit and abuse employees, you may make money in the short-term. But, over time, you will drive away good employees and erode your ability to provide a quality product and service. Without good employees, there is no good service. Without good service, there are no customers and therefore no revenue.


### It Takes All Three

It is impossible to reach your goal of short and long term financial without taking care of all three groups. Saying, "Make money in the short-term and long-term" is equivalent to saying, "Take care of customers, employees, and investors."
